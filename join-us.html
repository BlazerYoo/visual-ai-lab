                <li>If you're <b>interested in doing a postdoc</b> in the Visual AI Lab, please email me a brief description of
                    your research
                    interests, a link to your homepage, and your CV. Please specifically meantion any leadership roles
                    you've taken on
                    (academic or otherwise) as well as any work you've done to build a more inclusive scientific
                    community. You should also
                    consider applying for the Princeton AI lab postdoc positions and/or for the Princeton Center for IT
                    Policy fellows

                <li>If you're <b>applying to study at Princeton</b>, there is no need to email me. I apologize that I may not
                    be able to respond.
                    To ensure that I read your application, please: (1) apply to the Princeton CS PhD program, (2)
                    declare a specialization
                    in AIML or Vision, and (3) mention my name in the application. I look forward to meeting you once
                    youâ€™re admitted.
                </li>

                <li>If you're <b>interested in a temporary research position</b> in the Visual AI Lab, unfortunately it is
                    unlikely we will be able
                    to accommodate at this time. We get many requests for visiting researchers and Iâ€™m unfortunately
                    unable to respond to
                    all such inquiries.</li>

                <li>
                    If you're an <b>AI4ALL alum</b>, feel free to email me with questions. Be sure to include "AI4ALL", the
                    program you attended
                    and the year in the subject so it doesn't get lost. If you attended Princeton AI4ALL and are asking
                    for a letter of
                    recommendation, please instead email the Program Coordinator; put my name and the ai4all at
                    princeton dot edu email
                    address as your recommender.

                <li>
                    If you're a <b>high school student interested in research</b> unfortunately the only options we have
                    available at the moment
                    are through Princeton AI4ALL (for low-income 10th grade students) and (occasionally) through
                    Princeton Lab Learning
                    Program. You can also search for other AI4ALL summer programs for high school students: e.g.,
                    Stanford AI4ALL, UCSF
                    AI4ALL.
